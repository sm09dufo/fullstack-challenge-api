# Getting Started with fullstack-challenge-api

There are plenty of suggestions and further work that I'd like to do with this project. I'd love the opportunity to discuss them more.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the api in the development mode.\
Should run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) where the api can be hit from.

You need an .env file in your directory with two variables: ATLAS_URI (MongoDB database) and PORT (set to 5050).

For my database, I had the db named "games" and the collection named "games".
